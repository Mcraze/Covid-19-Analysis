# Covid-19 Real Time Analysis

### Problem Statement:
The COVID-19 Weekly Analysis Dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the global COVID-19 situation by analyzing preceding and last 7-day cases, deaths, and other key metrics. The objective is to identify trends, track the progression of the pandemic, and gain insights into the impact of the virus at a global and country level.

### Questions to be Addressed:
- How do the number of new COVID-19 cases in the preceding 7 days compare to the last 7 days?
- Which continent has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the last 7 days, as shown in the donut chart?
- What does the line graph comparing the preceding and last 7-day total cases reveal about the trend of COVID-19 cases?
- What is the percentage difference in COVID-19 cases between the preceding period and the current period?
- What is the percentage decrease in COVID-19 deaths between the two time periods specified?
